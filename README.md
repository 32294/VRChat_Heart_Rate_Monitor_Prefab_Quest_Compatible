# VRChat Heartrate Monitor Prefab (Quest Compatible)

All that I ask is two things:
- If you place this on a avatar you plan to sell, please provide credit in the form of a link back to this repository. Please do not raise the price of your avatar because of adding this prefab, you are not to make money off of it directly.
- If you make any substantial changes that would benefit other players, please fork the repository and publish said changes. Preferably also make a pull request.

## Setup
This project was meant to be used with [this](https://github.com/RichardVirgosky/VRChat-Heart-Rate-Monitor) OSC app, I do not plan to support any other OSC apps.

- Install the previously mentioned OSC app above, **make sure to leave the OSC parameter as the default in its settings (`heartRate`). Do not add it to you're avatar's parameters. VRCFury will merge it in on upload.**
- Install VRCFury using the VRC Creator Companion or Unity Package
- Install the newest version of [Poiyomi shaders](https://github.com/poiyomi/PoiyomiToonShader/releases)
- Make sure your avatar has at least 8 synced bits free in its parameters
- Install the unity package for this project (found in the releases page) or by clicking [here](https://github.com/32294/VRChat_Heart_Rate_Monitor_Prefab_Quest_Compatible/releases/download/2.0.0/heartrate_monitor_2_0_0.unitypackage) 
- Place the configurator prefab (`Assets\32294\heartrate_monitor\(ADD ME) Configure Monitor.prefab`) on your avatar
- Select the relevant options you want in the `Heart Rate Monitor Settings` script and click `Configure` to get a prefab with those options
- If you wish to have sound, use the `Heart Rate Sound Object` script as well and place the prefab it provides where you want the source of the sound to be.
- Upload the avatar, VRCFury will merge all animations and parameters.
- **Make sure you have OSC enabled in the ingame Radial Menu**
